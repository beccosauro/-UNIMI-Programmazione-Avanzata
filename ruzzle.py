'''
Ruzzle is a grid (4Ã—4) based game where each element of the grid is a letter and the aim of the game consists in determining all the possible English words out of all possible 
paths in the grid (where a path is a sequence of adjacent grid elements).

The exercise consists of writing a function ruzzles that calculates all the English words hidden in a given grid with the following simplifications/constraints:

- the minimum length for a word is 3 characters;
- an entry is considered adjacent to another if it is immediately at left, at right, above or below it (no diagonals are considered); note that a word can also be hidden in the
 grid in its reversed form (i.e., it can be read from right to left);
- no entry can be considered twice in the same word;
- the words should be checked against this dictionary;
- the list of resulting words must be alphabetically sorted;
- The input is a list of 4-character strings where each string represents a row in the grid and their position in the list mimic the position in the grid.'''
